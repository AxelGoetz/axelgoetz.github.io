The purpose of this visualisation was to convince a panel that [UCLU Techsoc](http://techsoc.io) should be nominated for the society of the year. Because what better way is there to convince someone than showing data in a nice format using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)?

So I made 5 different visualisations:
<ul>
<li><b>Member Data</b> - Shows the new members that joined the society on top (and in which year those members joined UCL) and the Facebook attendees on the bottom. This allowed us to see after which event we gained the most members.</li>
<li><b>Cumulative Data</b> - A cumulative member count.</li>
<li><b>Year Data</b> - In what year our members joined UCL so we could potentially target events.</li>
<li><b>Events Data</b> - All of the events we ran</li>
<li><b>Cool Facts</b> - See for yourself.</li>
</ul>
