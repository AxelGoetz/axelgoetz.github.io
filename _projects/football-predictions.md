[A machine learning solution](https://github.com/AxelGoetz/football-predictions/) written for UCL's [COMP312P - Machine Learning and Neural Computing](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/students/syllabus/undergrad/312p_machine_learning_and_neural_computing/) to predict the outcome of English Premier League games.

All information can be found in a Jupyter notebook in the [repo](https://github.com/AxelGoetz/football-predictions/).
Unfortunately, some of the data is not public. So if you would really like to run it, just send me a message.
