Website fingerprinting is a process where you attempt to identify which web pages
people are visiting over an encrypted network by analysing the raw traffic.

There have been a large variety of website fingerprinting attacks. However most of them require a very tedious process of feature-selection.
Therefore this project aimed to automate this process.
