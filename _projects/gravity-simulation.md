The index page's background of [my website](https://agoetz.me) was still fairly empty and I wanted a cool way to fill it up.
Inspired by [particles.js](http://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js) and [the Deepmind website](https://deepmind.com/), I created this project.

Essentially, it simulates gravity between every node and changes the velocity of that node accordingly.
The math is nothing too fancy, it just applies [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation).

If you want to use it for your own application, feel welcome to. There is a small description on how to use it on [the Github page](https://github.com/AxelGoetz/gravity-simulation)
