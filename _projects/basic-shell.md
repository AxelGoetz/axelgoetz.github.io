[A shell](https://github.com/AxelGoetz/basic-shell) written for UCL's [COMP3005 - Operating Systems](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/students/syllabus/undergrad/3005_operating_systems/) written in `C`.

It has the following features:

- Variable assignment for any variable ($HOME=/Users/...)
- Program execution (ls, cd, ...)
- Printing variables (printenv)
- Spacing and escape characters (cd "my directory" or cd my\ directory)
- Quit the shell (exit)

You can test it by first running the `make` command and then running the shel `./main`.
