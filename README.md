# axelgoetz.github.io
My own personal website.

## Setup
**Do not edit anything in the `_site` directory!** All of these files are autogenerated.

First you will need to have jekyll installed so run:
```
gem install jekyll
bundle install
```

Then to build and serve the website:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
